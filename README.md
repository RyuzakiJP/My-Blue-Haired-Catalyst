# My-Blue-Haired-Catalyst

Since my previous Spotify Account was taken down, everything is being hosted on a more "active account" 

(I dont use Spotify except for this kind of things)

My Blue-Haired Catalyst tells the story of a boy, that on the verge of death, gave up on everything he believed in to try and search for somewhere he belonged. 

Somewhere where he felt safe, trusted, loved.

  Well, that was quite a month. I've lived, died, went to purgatory and rose from the dead, all in a span of 2 weeks.

  Here's the recap: 
  - I've made some friends
  - Got shitfaced
  - fell in the worst state of despair and paranoia of my entire life
  - Drowned in an entire bottle of Rum & smoke an entire pack
  - almost killed myself (only stopped because of a promise I've made
  - Vented to a friend
  - Got some insights on where to go with my life
  - Vented to my best friend
  - Showed support to my best friend
  - Understood my true will
  - Understood the true meaning of love

  I can finally feel the warmth of the sunlight again, I am no longer trapped in the cold embrace of the shadows.

  I shall no longer need to drown myself into an entire bottle of Melatonin to be able to sleep.

  I shall no longer empty out an entire pack of cigarretes just to feel safe again.
  
  I shall no longer need to pass out so I can finally rest.

  I think I finally understand what I should do with my life. But first things first, I need to fix myself.

  Thanks for the support guys, it'll take me a while to recover, but you've helped a lot.

  Sorry for doubting you, you were the only ones that loved me in my darkest.

  And you were the only ones that helped me keep going through this shrouded road.

  We shall see each other again, but for now I must go.

  I still have to reach the end of this chapter, but at least this time I have hope.

  I have the strength to keep pushing, I have someone to care for, a Catalyst to ease away the burdens in my mind.
  
  My Catalyst is you, Lotus.

  I shall wear the ring as an homage of everything you and your brother mean to me.
